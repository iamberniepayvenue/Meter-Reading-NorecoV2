ActualConsumption(Extra2) = Pres. RDG - Prev. RDG see actual process in Accounts class in checkReading()
strDemands = for higher voltage class see actual process in Accounts class in checkReading()
senior citizen discount = if 1 - 20 kwh(consumption) for senior seniordiscount = (totallifeline - (totalLifeLine * lifelinerate)) * .05


Extra1 used for New Meter Serial Number
Extra2 used for Actual Consumption Regular Bill

 update ExportReading from connection_profile by new ExportReading...


Higher Voltage:
  Demand KW (reading demand kw) <= demandKWMinimum,demandKWMinimum will be the reference(Demand KW (reading) * RateSchedType contains 'PERKW,PERMO')
  if Demand KW (reading demand kw) > demandKWMinimum,demandKW(reading), Demand KW (reading) will be the reference (Demand KW (reading) * RateSchedType contains 'PERKW,PERMO')


Check Meter Type:
    M = Mother Meter
    R = Regular Meter
    S = Sub meter


    ExportBill = negative value of net metering amount, this will be downloaded
                    from billing profile and deduct to net metering payable if positive value.

kWhreading = threshold from billing_profile to determine the consumption wither very low or very high.
